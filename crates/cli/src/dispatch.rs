//! **Execution-class dispatch** — routing each dispatched attempt onto the
//! thread execution surface named by its resolved execution class.
//!
//! # The three surfaces
//!
//! The [`Dispatcher`] owns three execution surfaces, one per
//! [`ExecutionClass`](dagr_core::task::ExecutionClass):
//!
//! - **[`AwaitBound`](dagr_core::task::ExecutionClass::AwaitBound)** → the async
//!   (tokio) **task runtime**. The attempt future is `spawn`ed onto the
//!   multi-threaded `tasks` runtime and driven by its async workers — the natural
//!   home for network calls and waiting.
//! - **[`Blocking`](dagr_core::task::ExecutionClass::Blocking)** → tokio's
//!   **dedicated blocking pool** via `spawn_blocking`. A synchronous
//!   closure runs there so it cannot starve the async workers, and — because a
//!   `spawn_blocking` closure cannot be killed — its permit stays counted while it
//!   is abandoned-but-running; the run loop never joins it.
//! - **[`Compute`](dagr_core::task::ExecutionClass::Compute)** → a dedicated
//!   fixed-size **`rayon::ThreadPool`** (chosen over a capped semaphore over
//!   `spawn_blocking`). A pool built with `num_threads(N)` runs **at most N**
//!   closures concurrently regardless of how many are submitted, so "concurrently
//!   executing compute-class tasks never exceed the compute pool's size" is
//!   *structural in the pool*, and the blocking pool stays free for genuinely
//!   I/O-waiting work.
//!
//! # What this module owns, and what it consumes
//!
//! This module owns **only** the class→surface routing and the compute-pool
//! wiring. It **consumes** the pool sizes the admission controller was pinned
//! with: the compute pool is built to the pinned
//! [`compute_threads`](dagr_core::admission::PoolCapacities) capacity with the
//! floor-of-one rule. It does **not** change the permit mechanics (the
//! permit is still acquired by the loop and moved into the dispatched closure, so
//! its drop releases the cost on the attempt's return) nor re-derive the sizing.
//!
//! # Isolation is preserved
//!
//! The framework machinery (the loop, per-attempt timers, the event writer) runs
//! on the **isolated framework runtime** the driver builds; none of the three task
//! surfaces here are that runtime, so a task that jams every task/blocking/compute
//! worker cannot stall a timeout firing or the event stream — the
//! framework-survives-a-blocked-task guarantee is unchanged.
