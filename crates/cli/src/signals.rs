//! The **OS-signal → cancellation wiring**.
//!
//! This is the OS-signal half of cancellation. The cancellation *core* is built
//! elsewhere and exposes [`CancelHandle`] as the explicit
//! **signal seam** — the programmatic trigger a test fires and, in production, the
//! trigger an OS-signal handler fires. This module installs the handlers.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! [`install_signal_handlers`] registers handlers for the two orchestrator
//! termination signals — **`SIGTERM`** (the orchestrator's polite kill, e.g.
//! Kubernetes at the start of its `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`) and **`SIGINT`**
//! (an operator's Ctrl-C) — and wires **both** to fire the same
//! [`CancelHandle`]. The first delivery of either
//! signal starts the budgeted shutdown (the driver stops admitting new work, drains
//! in-flight cooperative work within grace, writes a complete + fsync'd stream, and
//! exits within the printed shutdown budget). The two signals are **observably
//! interchangeable** — both route to the identical cancellation path.
//!
//! # Re-entry hardening (a second signal does not shortcut the flush)
//!
//! A second identical signal *during* shutdown must not corrupt the shutdown path.
//! Both the underlying [`CancelHandle::cancel`]
//! (idempotent — first request wins the origin) and the routing here
//! ([`route_signal`]) are **re-entry hardened**: subsequent signals are counted
//! (observed, never dropped) but do **not** re-fire cancellation and do **not**
//! escalate to an immediate `process::exit` that would shortcut the final flush.
//! This is the contract — *"the first signal starts the budgeted
//! shutdown and subsequent ones do not shortcut the final flush"* — chosen over a
//! second-signal-forces-immediate-exit policy precisely because the shutdown budget
//! already bounds the wait, so an escalation would only risk truncating the
//! stream the budget guarantees.
//!
//! # Isolation
//!
//! Signal reception runs on its **own** single-worker runtime owned by the returned
//! [`SignalGuard`], separate from every task-execution surface, so a saturated
//! task fleet cannot starve signal delivery (consistent with the isolated
//! framework runtime). The handler does no work beyond firing the cheap, wait-free
//! `CancelHandle` — the real shutdown happens on the driver's framework runtime.
//!
//! # Platform posture (platform-conditional)
//!
//! Unix delivers `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` and this module installs real handlers via
//! `tokio::signal::unix`. On **non-unix** targets there are no POSIX termination
//! signals to wire; [`install_signal_handlers`] is a documented no-op returning a
//! guard, and the same cancellation is still reachable through the programmatic
//! [`CancelHandle`] seam. The end-to-end signal
//! coverage is therefore gated to unix (the platform matrix).
