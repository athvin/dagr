//! `dagr-core` — the dagr execution core (the live-pipeline surface).
//!
//! This crate holds dagr's authoring surface and execution core: the task
//! abstraction, typed handles, dependency binding, flow assembly, and the
//! run-loop machinery — the code that *is* a running pipeline. It is the crate
//! whose dependency set is kept minimal and review-gated (arch.md "Stability"),
//! and it is the "live pipeline" surface that renderers must never reach into
//! (arch.md C24 · Renderers).
//!
//! # What lives here so far
//!
//! The **C1 task abstraction** (ticket T9): the atomic unit of work.
//!
//! - [`task::Task`] — the trait an author implements on a configuration-holding
//!   `struct`, declaring C1's four elements: the consumed input type, the
//!   produced output type, the execution class ([`task::ExecutionClass`],
//!   default await-bound), and the `&mut self` work over a [`task::RunContext`]
//!   reference.
//! - [`TaskError`] — the task-facing classified error, three-valued
//!   (retry-eligible / permanent / deliberate skip) per the T3 ADR.
//!
//! The **C2 typed handle** (ticket T10): a typed claim on a value that does not
//! exist yet.
//!
//! - [`handle::Handle<T>`] — the cheap, freely copyable handle a node
//!   registration returns; it carries the node's [identity](handle::NodeId) plus
//!   the value type the node will produce, and it is the *only* way to refer to
//!   another node's output. It has no public constructor and no lookup by
//!   name/index/string key — a handle is obtained solely by registering a node.
//! - [`handle::NodeId`] — the opaque, name-derived identity token a handle
//!   carries (identity comes from the registration name, never from order).
//!
//! The **C3 typed data-dependency binding** (ticket T11): how a downstream node
//! declares its data dependencies at registration.
//!
//! - [`binding::Deps`] — the sealed positional encoding that binds one or more
//!   already-registered [`Handle`]s to a task, exact value-type and arity
//!   matching enforced at compile time (single input is a bare `Handle<T>`,
//!   multi-input a tuple up to [`binding::MAX_INPUT_ARITY`]).
//! - [`binding::ReceiveMode`] / [`binding::DataEdge`] — the per-edge receive mode
//!   (owned / shared / clone-on-read) recorded verbatim and left un-adjudicated
//!   (mode conflicts are assembly's job, C7 / T14).
//! - [`binding::NodeBinding`] — the trigger-rule typestate that makes any rule
//!   other than `all-succeeded` inexpressible on a data-dependent node.
//!
//! The flow builder (C7 / T13), assembly (T14), the run context's real
//! capabilities (C8 / T16), and the M1+ execution tickets land later; this crate
//! grows one component at a time.
//!
//! Lint posture is inherited from `[workspace.lints]`; this crate adds no
//! crate-level lint attributes.
